# coa-forms-v2

Headless, statically-generated forms using data from Formstack.

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn lint`

Must globally install eslint to use: `npm i -g eslint`.
`yarn lint --fix` will automatically fix some errors.
We use airbnb's style guide with a couple of rules modified in [.eslintrc](./.eslintrc).
